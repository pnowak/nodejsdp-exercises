# 4.3 Recursive find:

Write `recursiveFind()`, a callback-style function that takes a path to a directory in the
local filesystem and a keyword, as per the following signiature:
````
function recursiveFind(dir, keyword, cb) {}
````

The function must find all the text files within the given directory that contain 
the given keyword in the file contents.
The list of matching files should be returned using the callback when the search 
is completed.
If no matching file is found, the callback must be invoked with an emty array. 
As an example test case, if you have the files `foo.txt`, `bar.txt`, and `baz.txt`, in `myDir` and the keyword `batman` is conained in the files `foo.txt` and `baz.txt`, you should be able to run the following code:
````
recursiveFind(myDir, 'batman', console.log)
// should print ['foo.txt', 'baz.txt']
````

Bonus points if you make the search recursive
(it looks for text files in any subdirectory as well). 
Extra bonus points if you manage to perform the search within different files 
and subdirectories in parallel, but be careful to keep the number of parallel tasks 
under control.
